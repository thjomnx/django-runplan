django-runplan
=====================

This Django application allows registered and authenticated
users to create appointments for upcoming runs (in the
meaning of "sports").

Users may create appointments, add contact details, comment
on planned appointments, organize transportation to the
starting point and agree or reject to join in the run.

This project is under development - I only work on it in case
I find the time for it.

Cheers :)
