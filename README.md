django-runplan
=====================

This Django application allows registered and authenticated
users to create appointments for upcoming runs (in the
meaning of "sports").

Users may create appointments, add contact details, comment
on planned appointments, organize transportation to the
starting point and agree or reject to join in the run.

The application provides some templates which can be integrated
in another project setup. The current template status provides
dedicated views for desktop and mobile browser access. Thus the
application template rely heavily on

- Bootstrap (>= v2.3.2)
- jQuery (>= v2.1.0)
- jQuery UI (>= v1.10.4)
- jQuery Mobile (>= 1.4.0)
- and some other nice and fancy plugins ;)

A basic e-mail notification feature is also available. User may
customize their preferences on notifications in a settings area.

Localization is available for english and german language. Feel
free to fork and add your own translation!

There is only a minimal set of unit tests so far ... yes I know!

This project is in constant development - I only work on it
in case I find the time for it.

Cheers :)
